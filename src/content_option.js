    aboutme: `I'm an accomplished tech enthusiast, driven by a lifelong passion for coding. My repertoire includes C++, Java, JavaScript, React.js, React Native, and web development.

    A graduate of Albania's premier computer science and electrical engineering institution, I excel in delivering practical solutions.

    I aspire to a tech-immersed life, whether remotely or hands-on, having gained practical experience with two Albanian tech companies and numerous hackathon triumphs.

    Contributing to businesses' online presence in Albania is my forte, and I believe my vision and skills can make a significant impact.

    Embracing the spirit of Leonardo da Vinci, I am dedicated to creativity, mastering diverse domains, and the never-ending pursuit of knowledge.`,
